Flutter 30 days challenge is an app build during the #30daysofflutterchallenge. It contains several demo UI's which I took a challenge for a particular date. You can the code for each page in this repository. I focused on writing clean and reusable code. I refactored and tried to keep the structure clean and understandable.

### Topics Covered

* **Gesture Detector** : Gesture Detector has been used to detect horizontal drags to navigate across screens.

* **Custom Painter & Clipper** : To achieve custom layout and shapes custom clippers and painters are used. You can find the painters used [here](https://github.com/AmanNegi/flutter_30_days/tree/main/lib/painters).

* **Animations and Delayed Animation** : Complex and abstract animations are created using Intervals and AnimationController. Find the related code [here](https://github.com/AmanNegi/flutter_30_days/blob/main/lib/pages/welcome_page.dart).

* **Stack & Positioned** : Stack and Positioned are extensively used in the UI build, as it's very helpful in every situation.

* **Slivers** : Slivers are used to get custom scrollable screens and layouts. You can find the related code [here](https://github.com/AmanNegi/flutter_30_days/blob/main/lib/pages/sliver_page.dart).

* **Value Notifier & Value Listenable Builder** : Value notifiers and Value listeners are used to transmit and listen to data, and to effectively manage state.

* **PageView, ListView, GridView** : To create list of items/pages the listView, gridview and pageview were used with custom animations to show custom effects.
